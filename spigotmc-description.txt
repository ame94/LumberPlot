Tired of players not replanting after harvest? Sick of players putting blocks that don't belong in the farm or it simply just getting griefed?

[B]LumberPlot[/B] solves these issues and more.

[B][SIZE=6]-- NOTICE! --[/SIZE][/B]
This plugin is in its early stages of testing and could have some bugs, please report to me anything you find! Suggestions & feature requests welcome.

[SIZE=5][B]Requirements:[/B][/SIZE]
LumberPlot's only requirement is WorldEdit.

[SIZE=5][B]Features:[/B][/SIZE]
[LIST=1]
[*]Automatic sapling replacement when the log at the base of the tree is harvested.
[*]Works with all (currently six) tree varieties.
[*]Players may only break logs, leaves & vines and nothing else.
[*]Players cannot place any blocks yet bonemeal usage still permitted.
[*]Drops from Leaf block decay removed to prevent lag. Saplings, apples etc can still be obtained if leaf blocks are broken individually.
[*]Quickly define any number of plots with WorldEdit's selection wand.
[*]Multiple world support (Multiverse or anything similar).
[*]Allows quick adjustments inside plots with permission node or while in creative.
